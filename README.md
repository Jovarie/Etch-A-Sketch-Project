# Etch-A-Sketch-Project
testing use of my HTML, CSS ,GIT and DOM manipulation skills i'll be creating a sketch pad from scratch, by the end of this project i'll have demonstrated my skills and talents and as aspiring software developer.

Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
You need make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). This is a perfect opportunity to apply what you have learned about flexbox.
Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!
